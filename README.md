# Prolog MSDF Tools

The code in this repository was developed between 2001 and 2004,
at the Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University, Denmark.
It was used in connection with undergraduate lectures on
_Fundamental Concepts and Formal Semantics of Programming Languages_.
See the [lecture notes] for explanations and exercises.

The only changes made in the present version concern the filename
extension used for Prolog files (which is now `.pro` instead of `.pl`).
The code should run without errors or warnings using [SWI-Prolog],
otherwise kindly send a bug report to 
[p.d.mosses@swansea.ac.uk](mailto:p.d.mosses@swansea.ac.uk),
including relevant details of how to replicate the problem.

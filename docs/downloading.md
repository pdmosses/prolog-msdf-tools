# Downloading

The original MSOS code is available for browsing at:

* <https://github.com/pdmosses/prolog-msos-tool/tree/master/MSOS>

and for downloading as a zip archive:

* <https://github.com/pdmosses/prolog-msos-tool/blob/master/MSOS.zip>

To unpack the archive and create or update the MSOS directory:
```
unzip MSOS.zip
```

*Note:* Before updating from a new zip archive, rename your previous MSOS.
This ensures that obsolete files are removed from MSOS, and prevents
overwriting of any files that you have added to your copy of MSOS.

The code in the [MSOS] folder was developed between 2001 and 2004,
at the Department of Computer Science, Aarhus University, Denmark.
It was used in connection with undergraduate lectures on
_Fundamental Concepts and Formal Semantics of Programming Languages_.
See the [lecture notes] for explanations and exercises.

The only changes made in the present version concern the filename
extension used for Prolog files (which is now `.pro` instead of `.pl`).
The code should run without errors or warnings using [SWI-Prolog],
otherwise kindly send a bug report to 
[p.d.mosses@swansea.ac.uk](mailto:p.d.mosses@swansea.ac.uk),
including relevant details of how to replicate the problem.
